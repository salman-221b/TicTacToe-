    <h1>Instructions to Run the Tic Tac Toe Game</h1>

    <ol>
        
        <li>Download the Tic Tac Toe project folder from the GitHub repository. You can do this by navigating to the repository on GitHub and clicking on the "Code" button, then selecting "Download ZIP." Extract the contents of the ZIP file to a location on your computer.</li>
        
        <li>Open MATLAB and navigate to the location where you extracted the project folder using the "Current Folder" pane in MATLAB's interface.</li>
        
        <li>Once you are in the project folder, locate the MATLAB script file named "tic_tac_toe.m". This is the main script that runs the game.</li>
        
        <li>Double-click on the "tic_tac_toe.m" file to open it in the MATLAB Editor.</li>
        
        <li>In the MATLAB Editor, click on the "Run" button or press "Ctrl+Enter" to execute the script and start the Tic Tac Toe game.</li>
        
        <li>A graphical user interface (GUI) window will appear, allowing you to select the game mode. Currently, the only available mode is Player vs. Player (PvP).</li>
        
        <li>In the PvP mode, enter the names of the two players in the corresponding text boxes and click the "START" button.</li>
        
        <li>The Tic Tac Toe game will then launch in a new window. Each player takes turns clicking on the empty cells to place their symbol (either a dot or a cross). The game will automatically detect wins, ties, and update the score.</li>
        
        <li>After the game ends, a "Play Again!" button will appear. You can click this button to restart the game and play again.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Enjoy playing Tic Tac Toe!</p>
